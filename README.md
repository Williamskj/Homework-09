## Description
This application is an automatic README.md Generator, that uses Inquirer, Node.js, and FS. 
## Installation
This application requires several things to work properly. It requires access to Node.js, Inquirer NPM, and a IDE. One must allso have inquirer installed and have access to a terminal or Gitbash.
## Usage
First, you must access your terminal in your IDE, or Gitbash if your IDE doesn't have an integrated Terminal. Then, you must input 'node index.js' into your terminal. This will cause a prompt to appear, at which, you answer the question. Once you have answered all of them, you will notice a new file in your current directory. It should be a readme file, organized and with all your inputs from the questions you just answered.
